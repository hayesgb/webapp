# webapp

This repository was created as a test project for my personal website.  It serves several functions in this capacity:

1.  As a way to learn more about the newest Python asynchronous functionality
2.  Writing and blending Javascript with Python, including D3.js and Vue.js
3.  Working more with Bootstrap
4.  Implementing this on an Azure webapp via a Docker container
